sensitivity studies for cmip5/pmip3 data
===========================================================
* we will be using a few sets of sensitivity studies, based on the ice extent and permeability of sea ice
* to do this, we will use the interpolated grid of the pmip3 data sic (this is 7 models) to the uvic model grid
* therefore, we have monthly grids of objectively interpolated sic. 
* next, we want to test the permeability of the ice on the experiment, so we want to move from 1 (rigid lid) : 0.05 : 0.5 (semi-permeable)
* do we want to run a 3D grid of data inputs of the form: [wind, sic, permeability]?
	- how do we want to parameterize the wind?
		+ greater than 50 deg Lat
		+ greater than 50 deg Lat and also only in times of deep water formuation (winter)
		+ PDFs of wind in the areas of interest (spatio temporal) and then run over these values (10 discretized or smthn)
			* what do these look like? over the entire region (area weighted)? or per grid cell that we then just grab the nth sd/var from each pdf across all models?
* get rid of x_atm in the scripts with no lgm modification. 
* run just the pmip3 data interpolated sic in the uvic
* email samar about gas exchange modulation coefficient
* email roo about pdf generation of pmip3 data
* single bubble model pilot data for nasa finesst
	* single bubble deposited in depth radius and 
* email tristan about nasa finesst

* what is the exact runtime parameter for gas piston ice injection permeability
* change x_atm from/to:
	N2: 780840
	Ne: 18.180000
	Ar: 9303.0136
	Kr: 1.1414136
